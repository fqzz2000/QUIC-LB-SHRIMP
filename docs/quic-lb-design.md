# QUIC Load Balancer Design Document

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the design of a QUIC load balancer implementation based on the QUIC-LB draft specification. The design focuses on core functionality while maintaining extensibility for future features.

### 1.1 Scope

The implementation will focus on:
- Connection ID-based routing
- Basic packet forwarding
- Configuration management
- Support for encrypted Connection IDs
- Health monitoring

### 1.2 Components

The system consists of three main components:
- Load Balancer (LB)
- QUIC Servers
- Configuration Agent

Note: No modifications are required for QUIC clients as the load balancing is transparent to them.

## 2. Core Architecture

### 2.1 Load Balancer Design

#### 2.1.1 Key Components

1. **Packet Processor**
   - Extracts Connection IDs from QUIC packets
   - Handles different packet types (Initial, Handshake, 1-RTT)
   - Performs minimal packet validation

2. **Routing Engine**
   - Maps Connection IDs to server instances
   - Supports different routing algorithms
   - Maintains routing table

3. **Configuration Manager**
   - Manages load balancer configuration
   - Handles config rotation
   - Distributes configuration to servers

4. **Server Health Monitor**
   - Monitors server health
   - Manages server pool
   - Updates routing decisions based on health

#### 2.1.2 Data Structures

```go
type LoadBalancer struct {
    servers       map[string]ServerInfo
    routingTable  map[ConnectionID]ServerID
    config        Config
    encryptionKey []byte
}

type Config struct {
    serverIDLength  uint8
    nonceLength     uint8
    encryptionKey   []byte
    rotationBits    uint8
}

type ServerInfo struct {
    ID        ServerID
    Address   string
    Health    HealthStatus
    Stats     Statistics
}
```

### 2.2 Server Integration

Servers need to:
- Receive and apply configuration from LB
- Generate compliant Connection IDs
- Support config rotation

### 2.3 Configuration Agent

- Manages configuration distribution
- Handles key rotation
- Coordinates configuration updates

## 3. Core Functionality

### 3.1 Connection ID Routing

1. **Basic Routing**
   - Extract Connection ID from packet
   - Lookup server mapping
   - Forward packet to appropriate server

2. **Connection ID Format**
   ```
   +--------+------------------+------------+
   | Config |    Server ID     |   Nonce    |
   | Bits   |                  |            |
   +--------+------------------+------------+
   ```

3. **Encryption Support**
   - Support for encrypted Connection IDs
   - Key management
   - Rotation handling

### 3.2 Packet Handling

1. Process incoming packets
2. Validate packet type
3. Extract routing information
4. Forward to appropriate server
5. Handle retransmission and connection migration

## 4. Evolution Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality
